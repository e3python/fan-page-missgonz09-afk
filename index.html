<!-- This is the beginning of my Bio section, Why we shouldn't wear uniforms in school.  -->
    <h3>The pros and cons of wearing a uniform in school.</h3>
    <p>One of the pros for this topic is that ues the school will be able to recognise who comes from what school and make their job easier. Another good thing about wearing a uniform is that all students are wearing the same thing, which will be less issues with other students being judged for what they wear. Now, the pros about not wearing a uniform are that students will be free to choose what they want to wear and feel comfortable with how they look. Another pro about not wearing uniforms in school is that the students can show who they are and be free to express themselves.</p>
